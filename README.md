# AutoTagger for Alfred

This Alfred 5 workflow is designed for seamless integration with SortedÂ³ but can be customized for any URL scheme. It enables you to specify tags and related terms in an inline YAML configuration, customize URL schemes with dynamic placeholders `[title]`, `[tags]`, and `[today]`, and utilize a designated keyword for tagging.

Tags are automatically generated based on the items listed in the query, while URLs are excluded. For usage examples, please refer to the unit tests in [tests.py](tests.py)
